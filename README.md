# ImageBlur Detection

To check whether an image is Blur or Not in Android, selecting image via Camera/Gallery


OpenCV library is used for Blur detection.

Download OpenCV by selecting a stable version of Android pack from [here](https://opencv.org/releases.html).
Integrating OpenCV to studio-project is quite a long procedure. Please refer this [awesome](https://medium.com/@sukritipaul005/a-beginners-guide-to-installing-opencv-android-in-android-studio-ea46a7b4f2d3) article.


#### APK Size
APK size is the main concern when we want to integrate with OpenCV.
* Debug APK size -  86 MB
* Debug APK size with Progaurd - 84.4 MB
* Debug APK size with Progaurd and R8 - 80 MB
* Debug APK size with Progaurd + R8 + NDK abiFilters  - 24 MB
